This is my portfolio site. I used React.js and the WordPress REST API to build a headless CMS to easily change content without adjusting code. 

Check out my initial design and prototype that I made... It changed quite a lot during my planning stages. I made it in Adobe XD.
You can change pages and get hover effects. There is also a working mini carousel!
